Playlist (Javascript object) with some of my favorite songs. Track and artist input updates html element with song/artist/album/year and the youtube video displayed. Program restricts "Track Number" input with an event listener. If a correct artist name is entered, the program restricts the track number selection based on the length of the artist object. It also restricts access to the "Track Number" input element (input is disabled) if an incorrect artist name is entered. This occurs when the "Artist Name" input element loses focus/ when the user leaves the "Artist Name" input field. Made without a tutorial.

* Idea: I wanted to learn how to make and use javascript objects so I decided to make an interactive music video playlist where the user could change artists/tracks.

* Goals:
    * Learn how to make an object
    * Learn how to access the properties of an object 
    * Learn about the HTML DOM
    * Learn to use JavaScript to access and change elements of an HTML document
    * Learn how user input can change which javascript object property is accessed
