# music-player


Playlist (Javascript object) with some of my favorite songs. Track and artist input updates html element with song/artist/album/year and the youtube video displayed. Made without a tutorial/instructions.

* Idea: I wanted to learn how to make and use javascript objects so I decided to make an interactive music video playlist where the user could change artists/tracks.

* Purpose:
    * Learn how to make an object
    * Learn how to access the properties of an object 
    * Learn how user input can change which object property is accessed
